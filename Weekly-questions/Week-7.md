## Which methods may be applied for studying structures of DNA binding proteins?

**Gel retardation and modification assays** have been used to *map* attachment sites for DNA-binding proteins (motifs) in regions adjacent to many genes in different species.

Methods for identifying structures of DNA binding proteins are:

**X-Ray crystallography**

**NMR: Nuclear magnetic resonance**

## What are examples of DNA binding motifs? Caracteristics?

Examples of DNA binding motifs are:

**Helix-turn-helix family**:

Characteristics of this family is that the first helix and turn enables the second helix to gain access to the major groove of a DNA molecule.

**Zinc-finger family**:

Characteristics of this family is that cysteine and/or histones are holding a zinc molecule. It is usually comprised of Beta-sheets and helixes, where one of the helix is the one making critical contact with the DNA molecule.

**Ribbon-helix-Helix**:

With this conformation it is the Beta-sheet that is making the contact with the major groove of a DNA molecule.

**Basic helix-loop-helix**:

The N-terminal helix is the one making contact with the DNA molecule.
