RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing genes that code for proteins.

In eukaryotes, the term promoter is used to describe all the sequences that are important in initiating a transcription of a gene. There are several of these, some called **core promoter** but also **upstream promoter elements** which lie upstream of the core promoter.

**ALternative promoters** are used in different tissues and direct synthesis of mRNAs of different length. Can also be called **multiple promoters**.

### Synthesis of eukaryotic RNA is regulated primarily by activator proteins

Transcription initiation can be influenced by DNA-binding proteins that recognize specific sequences located near the attachment site for RNA polymerase. Eukaryotic genes have a low rate of transcription initiations, regardless of how strong the promoter is. In order to achieve effective initiation, formation of the complex must be activated by additional proteins. What complex? Polymerase 2 and 3!

Bacteria have only the RNA polymerase, not different varieties of it. Eukaryotes employ a different strategy for transcription initiation where activators are playing a much more prominent role than repressor proteins.
