# Questions for the colloquium lecture 9

#### What is the difference between direct and indirect activation of gene expression?

**Direct activation**: Signaling compound enters the cells

- To affect the genome expression directly, a compound must transverse the plasma membrane of the cells

Inside the cell, the compound could act as a:

- Transcription factor
- Activator/repressor
- Splicing *enchancer* or *silencer*

There are not many compounds that act as a **direct** activator or repressor for gene expression.

**Indirect activation**: Signal transduction via a cell surface receptor

*The difference between direct and indirect activation of gene expression is that direct activation can enter the plasma membrane without help from cell surface proteins, and indirect cannot.*

The compounds that are linked with direct activation has hydrophobic properties, making it easy to transverse the membrane.

#### Which barrier limits signal compounds to enter the cell?

The plasma membrane

#### What is the objective of receptors in the plasma membrane?

Receptors on the membrane surface transmit signals across cell membranes. Receptor proteins have a binding site where a hydrophilic signaling compound (too hydrophilic to enter the membrane) may bind. This results in a conformational change of the protein receptor, inducing a biochemical event which forms the first step in the intracellular stage of the **signal transduction** pathway.

There are several types of cell surface receptors, but most of those **mediating changes in the genome expression** are **kinase** or **kinase-associated receptors**.

The most important example is the **tyrosine kinase receptors**, which add phosphates to tyrosine amino acids in their target proteins.

#### What are (steroid) hormones?

**Steroid hormones** are signaling compounds that coordinate a range of physiological activities in the cells of higher eukaryotes. They include:

- **Sex hormones** (estrogen for female sex development and androgen for male sex development)

- **Glucocoricoid and mineralcoricoid homrones**

Steroids are hydrophobic and therefore easily penetrates the cells membrane. Once inside the cell, a hormone binds to a **specific steroid receptor** protein. After binding, it migrates into the nucleus where it attaches to a **hormone response element** upstream of a **target gene**. Once bound, the receptor acts as a transcription activator.

#### What is the function of kinases?

The function of kinases are to add phosphates to specific amino acids of proteins, which then phosphorylate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) who can enter the nucleus and affect gene expression.

#### How may Ras be activated/deactivated?

Ras is part of the MAPKinase pathway.

1. Ras is **inactive** when a **GDP (guanosine-diphosphate)** is bound to it.

2. **GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors)** help ras replace a GDP with a **GTP (guanosine triphosphate)**.

3. When Ras is bound to GTP it is **active**.

4. Ras becomes inactive again when **GAPs (GTPase activation protein)** stimulate Ras to convert its GTP to GDP

*The balance between GEF and GAP affects the signal transmission further downstream in the signaling pathway.*

#### How are permanent changes in the genome created?

Permanent changes of the genome can be done through changes in the **chromatin structure** or the **physical rearrangement** of the genome.

**Changes in the chromatin structure**: This can be done through the polycomb response elements + PcG protein formation.

- The polycomb response element is large and contains several binding sites for the Pcg protein. Binding of these PcG proteins *recruits* other proteins that are involved in gene repression. This involves

  - **Histone methyltransferases**
  - **Ubiquitin modifying enzymes**

The protein PRC2 attaches to PcG, and then PRC1 attaches to PRC2 which then leads to **histone ubiquinitation activity**.


**Physical rearrangment**: Gene conversion is a physical rearrangement of the genome, where one part is deleted or replaced by another.

It is an effective by drastic way for bringing about a permanent change in the genome expression during cell differentiation.

One examples is the **yeast mating type** that are determined by gene conversion.



#### Give an example how changes in the chromatin structure influence gene expression

#### How is the enormous variation in immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors created?

Humans can make 10^8 different immonuglobulins or T-cell receptors, but there are only 20 441 protein coding genes. How is this possible?

The variability of it lies in the N-terminal region. The C-terminal parts are very similar and constant.

- There are no complete genes for heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulins, but there are gene segments that make up the structure.

**The rearrangement of the genome are responsible for immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors diversity.** "Alternative splicing sort of".
