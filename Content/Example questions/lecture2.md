##### What are the three laws of Mendel?

**First law, Law of Dominance** - If a dominant allele is present it will show in the phenotype. If no dominant allele is present the recessive allele will show

**Second law, Law of Segregation** - This law states that a pair of alleles will be separated from each other during meiosis.
Segregation: "To separate or et apart from others from the main body"

**Third law, Law of Independent Assortment** - Alleles of one trait do not affect the allele of another trait. They separate independently. In other words the genes inherited from one chromosome is inherited independently of traits on another chromosome?

##### What are the major phases of mitosis and meiosis?

**Mitosis** - It is a process where diploid somatic cell divides to form two equal diploid daughter cells.

*Phases*:

- **Interphase** - The genetic material has not yet condensed and is still in a open configuration.

- **Late prophase** - After condensation, the chromosome have formed structures visible with the light microscope.

- **Metaphase** - During metaphase, the nuclear membrane breaks down and the chromosomes are lined up in the center of the cell.

- **Anaphase** - The microtubules now draw the daughter chromosomes toward either end of the cell.

- **Telophase** - In telophase. nuclear membranes re-form around each collection or separated daughter chromosome at each end. The result is that the parent nucleus has given rise to two identical daughter nuclei.



**Meiosis** - Process that occurs only in reproductive cells. It results in four haploid gametes (cells) where each gamete can fuse for sexual reproduction.

- **Interphase** - The chromosome is starting to form and after condensation, homologous pairs line up and form *bivalents* with other homologous pairs. In meiosis the pairs are not independent or separated as it is with mitosis.

- **Prophase 1** - In prophase 1 the bivalent has formed and crossing over might occur, involving breakage of chromosome arms and exchange of DNA.

- **Anaphase 1** - The two homologous pairs now separates (crossover of DNA might have happened and are now separated into either end of the cell). Nuclei are now formed around the separated chromosomes.

- **Prophase 2** - The forward process now resembles more that of mitosis. The chromosomes are now separated within a nuclei each. There are now two nuclei within the cell.

- **Metaphase 2** - The nuclei are now opened up again, and the homologous pairs are lined up.

- **Anaphase 2** - The homologous pairs are now separated by the microtubules. There are now four separate areas with genetic material.

- **Telophase 2** - 4 nuclei now form, each carrying a single copy of each chromosome. These are haploid cells. Diploid cells have chromosome pairs.

##### What is the principal difference between mitosis and meiosis?

The difference is that **meiosis** contributes to variations in a species. Meiosis is the cell cycle for a sexual reproductive cell.


##### What is genetic linkage?

Genetic linkage is the idea that **genes that are close together on a chromosome tend to be inherited together**

##### What is "junk DNA"?

"Junk DNA" is noncoding DNA that appears to have no biological function. Noncoding DNA can have gene regulatory function. Noncoding DNA that does not seem to have any biological function has been categorized as "junk DNA".

##### Which areas in the genome are difficult to map? Why?

Areas in the genome that contains repetitive sequences are hard to map with shotgun method.

This is because it might be hard to know the length of the repetitive sequence. This makes it hard to know the correct way to overlap the fragments near the repetitive end.

##### What are the differences between genetic and physical maps?

Genetic map | Physical maps
---- | -----
Studied through breeding experiments and pedigrees | Examines the DNA molecules directly
Poor resolution | Higher resolution

##### Why was genetic mapping in humans difficult?

A good method for doing genetic mapping is breeding experiments. Doing this with humans is not easy to do. It is unfavorable morally and when it comes to the time needed to perform it.

##### What are RFLPs, what are SSLPs, what SNPs? What can they be used for?

*Mapped features that are not genes are called **DNA markers***. As with gene markers, a DNA marker must have at least two alleles to be useful.

**RFLP**: restriction fragment length polymorphism.

Restriction enzymes cut DNA molecules at specific **recognition sequences**. This sequence specificity suggests that DNA treated with the same nucleases should produce the same fragments. **This is not true** because the recognition site might contain polymorphisms. The one allele might be cut because it doesn't contain polymorphism, and the other allele might not be affected because it does contain polymorphism. This means that the recognition site will be unrecognizable.

**THE RESULT OF THIS** is that two adjacent restriction fragments will still be linked together after treatment with the enzyme, leading to a length polymorphism.

This is an RFLP, and its position on a genome map can be worked out by following the inheritance of its alleles, just as is done when genes are used as markers.

**SSLP**: simple sequence length polymorphism.

SSLPs are quite different from RFLPs. SSLPs aare arrays of repeat sequences that show *length variations*, with different alleles containting *different numbers of repeat units*. Unlike RFLPs, SSLPs can be multiallelic, as each SSLP can have a number of different length variants. There are two types of SSLPs.

**Minisatellites** | **Microsatellites**
- | -
or *variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs)*. | or *short tandem repeats (STRs)*.
A repeat unit is up to **25** bp in length. | A repeat is shorter, usually 13 bp or less.
A more frequently found at the telomeric ends of a chromosome, and not spread evenly around the genome | Microsatellites are more conveniently spaced around the genome.

The fastest way to type a **length polymorphism** is by PCR, and Microsatellites are favoured because PCR works better with shorter sequences.


**SNPs** single nucleotide polymorphisms:
These are mutations that occur in a single basepair. Where one individual might have a G, another individual might have a C.

##### Which methods can be applied to detect and analyze SSLPs and RFLPs?

**RFLPs** can be typed by Southern Hybridization and PCR.

*Southern hybridization*: The DNA is digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme and separated in an agarose gel. The smear of restriction fragments is transferred to a nylon membrane and probed with a piece of DNA that **spans** the polymorphic restriction site. If the site is absent, then a single restriction fragment is detected. If the site is PRESENT, then two fragments are detected.

*PCR*: Using primers that anneal on either side of the polymorphic restriction site. After PCR, the products are treated with the appropriate restriction enzyme and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. If the site is ABSENT, then one band is seen on the agarose gel; if the site is present, then two bands are seen.

**SSLPs and how they are typed**: The sequence is amplified by PCR and the size is determined by either agarose gel or by a capillary column. The capillary column is favored because it is highly automated.
