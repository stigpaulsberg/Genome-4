# Questions for the colloquium lecture 1 (chapter 3)

### What is the difference between a prokaryote and a eukaryote cell?

Cell wall, nucleus, many more organelles in eukaryotes, size, prokaryotes can interchange DNA, prokaryotes don’t have chloroplasts or mitochondria.


### Why was protein favored as material for genes?

Proteins are way more diverse than DNA. DNA is made up from only 4 different bases


### What do you think, why was the work of Franklin not enough appreciated?

??


### What is a polymer and why is a polymer the basis for heritage material?

The DNA is a polymer of 4 different nucleotides with a deoxyribose and phosphate group as their backbone. The central dogma in biology is DNA  mRNA  Protein. The proteins are made up from 20 different amino acids, each with a different side group for variety, this is the product of the mRNA formed after translation of the genes nucleotides. The translation is done by reading the nucleotides in a sequence of three, with each different order of the 4 nucleotides. Creating 4 in the 3 power different sequences called “codons”. The codons specify the arrangement of amino acids.
Point is – the sequence is three, a polymer. Polymer nucleotides  amino acids in sequence  protein



### Are there alternatives for the "central dogma in biology"?

Genome -> Transcriptome -> Proteome

DNA -> mRNA -> Protein.



### What are the reasons that different biological disciplines use different definitions for
"gene"?




### Why were the sequencing projects not started earlier?

The project is very costly, and there was debate on how to do it and also why


### What is the reason for that some species have a high number of chromosomes?

Hard to tell.
A higher amount of genes (information) means a higher standing organism. But higher amount of chromosomes does not correlate with this. A mouse has 95% of the information we have, but half the amount of chromosomes. A fish (carpe) has ??% amount of information, but over double the number of chromosomes.




### Why is the mitochondrial genome circular and contains only few genes?

Because it is theorized to be an ancient prokaryote (prokaryotes only have circular genome), that has merged with eukaryotes.




### What is "junk DNA"? Where does it come from? What is the meaning of it?

Junk DNA is old and seemingly useless DNA that has not gotten deleted from the genome.




### What is repetitive DNA? What are pseudogenes? Where do they come from?

Repetitive DNA are sequences that comes consequently after one another when reading along a DNA thread.




### Why is DNA so stable?

DNA is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds between its bases.
It is also stabilized by the stacking of the base pairs (thought to be pi-pi interactions, double binding).




### Why is it believed that RNA was "first"?


The RNA is a very varied construction.
The RNA works as a information storage and also a protein synthesizer because of the vital role that tRNA plays in the ribosomes assembly for polypeptide chains.
The RNA is also present in bacteria and virus, and at least bacteria is thought to be the first living thing on earth.

### What is alternative splicing and why is it useful?

Alternative splicing is a splicing pathway for pre-mRNA that processes the pre-mRNA in a variety of ways.
This gives rise to many different mRNA that are composed of different combinations of exons.
This is useful because the number of functions a gene has increases.
One gene can translate into more than one protein / function.




### What are housekeeping genes / proteins?

Housekeeping genes are proteins that are abundant and does not seem to have a specialized task to perform – their performance does not differ much from other abundant proteins.
These are general biological activities present in all cells.
