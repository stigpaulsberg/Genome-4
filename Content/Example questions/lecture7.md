# Questions for the colloquium lecture 7



#### Describe one examples of a DNA binding motif?

DNA binding proteins are divided into families defined by the structure of their DNA binding motifs

**2 major families:**

- **Helix-turn-helix (HTH)**
- **Zinc fingers**

I will be describing the HTH motif.

**HTH binding motif**

- Present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
- The second helix binds to the **majro groove** of DNA, the *DNA recognition helix*
- Main motif consists of 20 amino acids
- Other parts of the protein attaches to the surface of DNA.

HTH is part of a homeodomain protein and that means it is important in the developmental regulation of genome expression

- Extended HTH with 60 aminoacids
- 3x a-Helix
- Helix 2 and 3 forms the HTH
- Helix 3 is the recognition Helix
- Helix 1 stabilizes the structure

#### Show some examples of noncoding RNA and their various functions?

Non coding RNA - 90% of it is not translated into proteins, but the majority is actively transcribed and a large fraction may be functional.

**Transcriptome - Noncoding RNAs**

*4 major categories*

1. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) - ribosome component
2. Transfer RNA (tRNA) - amino acid transporter during translation
3. Short noncoding RNA (sncRNA) < 200 bp
4. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) > 200 bp

##### Ribosomal RNAs

**RNA-polymerase 1, 2 and 3.**


##### **Short noncoding RNA (sncRNA) < 200 bp**
Short noncoding RNA can have diverse functions.

tRNA was discovered in 1958, and it is a sncRNA.

**Small nuclear RNA (snRNA)** are present in the nucleus and are rich in Uracil.
- Can form complexes with ribonucleoproteins
- Others build the spliceosome in the speckles.

**Small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)** are located in the nucleoli, inside the nucleus.
These participate in the chemical modification of rRNAs.

**RNAs outside the nucleus are involved in RNA silencing**.

- *Short interfering RNA (siRNA)* - 20-25 nucleotides.
- Result in *silencing* of particular mRNAs
- *MicroRNAs (miRNAs)* are similar to siRNAs
- Participate in RNA interfering
- *PiwiRNA (piRNA)* - 25-30 nt long.
- Associate with piwi proteins
- Participate in gene repression.

sncRNA is also a constituent of the telomerase, the protein that prolongs the chromosomal ends.

##### Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)

These RNA covers a large portion of the intergenic areas of the human genome.
There are over 50 000 lncRNAs in the human genome
- They are often cell type specific
- They come in low copy numbers
- Some are found in intergenic regions
  - long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA)

Assigning function to lncRNA is difficult.

Panda is a decoy of a lncRNA. It works by making a transcription factor bind to the PANDA lncRNA instead of a gene, thereby hindering gene expression.

Some lncRNA named Xist and Tsix RNAs mediate the x inactivation in female mammals.

A higher copy number of one lncRNA has been associated with prostate cancer, and some other with breast cancer.

LncRNA are also involved in histone modification and the chromatin state eu-/heterochromatin.




#### How may long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression?

**Long non-coding RNA**: A noncoding RNA longer than 200 nucleotides in length.

lncRNA are involved in histone modification and chromatin states.

Transcriptional interference. It induces chromatin remodeling and histone modifications.

#### Which major types of RNA polymerases exist and what are their functions?

Polymerase | Types of RNAs
--- | ----
RNA polymerase 1 | 28S, 5.8S, 18S rRNAS
RNA polymerase 2 | mRNA, Sm family of snRNAs, some snoRNAs, siRNA, miRNA, piRNA, lncRNA
RNA polymerase 3 | tRNAs, 55 rRNAs, some snoRNAs.
Polymerase | function
RNA polymerase 1 |

Their function is to synthesize RNA in 5' -> 3' direction.

#### How are activators and repressors influencing transcription?

**Repressors** influence gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylases and methyl transferases.

**Activators** influence gene expression by recruitment of histone acetyl transferase


#### What is mRNA processing?

It is a processing of mRNA where mRNA gets modified so that it can be transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasma. The modifications are:

- Capping, where it modifies the 5' end of a mRNA molecule
- Polyadenylering, the newly transcribed mRNA gets adenyled in its 3' end, the poly A tail.

It is all done so that it can be transfered from the nucleus to the cytoplasma and making the mRNA more stable

#### What are the forms and features of alternative splicing?



#### What are the major steps in a microarray expression experiment?



#### What is clustering?



#### What can we measure applying chips and arrays?
