## What are the three laws of Mendel and what is the principle they are based on?

**1. Law**: "*Alleles segregate randomly*": Two parent alleles have equal chance of being inherited.

**2. Law**: "*Pairs of alleles segregate independently*": Inheritance of gene A is not associated with inheritance of gene B.

## What are the different phases of mitosis and meiosis?

Mitosis | Meiosis
- | -
**Interphase**: The genetics material is in the form of euchromatin, which is not yet condensed and ready for separation. | **Interphase**
**Late Prophase** | -
- | **Prophase 1**: Homologous chromosomes form a bivalent, homolog chromatids might stick together.
**Metaphase** | **Metaphase 1**
**Anaphase**: Separation of chromatids. | **Anaphase 1**: Crossing over has occured.
- | **Prophase 2**: Two cells form.
- | **Metaphase 2**:
- | **Anaphase 2**: four chromatids separate.
**Telophase**: Two duplicate cells form (daughter cell). | **Telophase 2**: Four gametes form.


## What are the problems with the shotgun-method?

There are *two* problems.

1. The first is that it might not be able to sequence enough short segments to produce a whole contigous DNA segment.

2. The second is that errors might occur because a genome contains **repetitive DNA** sequences, making it hard to pinpoint exact location of a segment.

A genome map helps battle these two problems.

Genome maps have become less used because of better computer algorithms which can identify repetitive sequences and perform steps to avoid errors when putting sequences together.

## What happens in the cell during the different different stage of mitosis and meiosis?

Answered in the question above.

## Why had Thomas Morgan doubts about the work of Mendel?



## What is the advantage to go genetic experiments with fruit flies?

Fruit flies have many visable phenotypes and they are cheap to maintain and they breed often.

## What is genetic linkage?

It has something to do with the inheritance of genes. Genetic linkage is the idea that genes that are close together on a chromosome tend to be inherited together during meiosis.

## Hay are genomic maps important?

That is because the modern DNA sequencing tools has a major limit: only with the most recent tech shit, it can only sequence more than 750 bp in a single experiment.

## What is the problem with mapping based on recombination markers?



## Are there certain areas in the genome, which are difficult to map? Why?

*Recombination hotspots* makes it harder for a physical mapping to be accurate. The frequency of recombination between two genes is not proportional to the distance between those two genes.



## What is the difference between genetic and physical maps? Which are more exact?



## Why is genetic mapping in humans difficult?

Genetic mapping in humans cannot be done with planned breeding experiments as this is unethical and inconvenient because a generation takes a long time to acquire.

For gene mapping purposes it is also necessary for a geneticist to study families where the parents, by chance, have different alleles. Two humans come together out of liking, not out of convenience for the genticist.

## What are RFLPs, what are SSLPs, what SNPs? What can they be used for?

*Mapped features that are not genes are called **DNA markers***. As with gene markers, a DNA marker must have at least two alleles to be useful.

**RFLP**: restriction fragment length polymorphism.

Restriction enzymes cut DNA molecules at specific **recognition sequences**. This sequence specificity suggests that DNA treated with the same nucleases should produce the same fragments. **This is not true** because the recognition site might contain polymorphisms. The one allele might be cut because it doesn't contain polymorphism, and the other allele might not be affected because it does contain polymorphism. This means that the recognition site will be unrecognizable.

**THE RESULT OF THIS** is that two adjacent restriction fragments will still be linked together after treatment with the enzyme, leading to a length polymorphism.

This is an RFLP, and its position on a genome map can be worked out by following the inheritance of its alleles, just as is done when genes are used as markers.

**SSLP**: simple sequence length polymorphism.

SSLPs are quite different from RFLPs. SSLPs aare arrays of repeat sequences that show *length variations*, with different alleles containting *different numbers of repeat units*. Unlike RFLPs, SSLPs can be multiallelic, as each SSLP can have a number of different length variants. There are two types of SSLPs.

**Minisatellites** | **Microsatellites**
- | -
or *variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs)*. | or *short tandem repeats (STRs)*.
A repeat unit is up to **25** bp in length. | A repeat is shorter, usually 13 bp or less.
A more frequently found at the telomeric ends of a chromosome, and not spread evenly around the genome | Microsatellites are more conveniently spaced around the genome.

The fastest way to type a **length polymorphism** is by PCR, and Microsatellites are favoured because PCR works better with shorter sequences.


**SNPs** single nucleotide polymorphisms:
These are mutations that occur in a single basepair. Where one individual might have a G, another individual might have a C.

## Which methods can be applied to detect and analyze SSLPs and RFLPs?

**RFLPs** can be typed by Southern Hybridization and PCR.

*Southern hybridization*: The DNA is digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme and separated in an agarose gel. The smear of restriction fragments is transferred to a nylon membrane and probed with a piece of DNA that **spans** the polymorphic restriction site. If the site is absent, then a single restriction fragment is detected. If the site is PRESENT, then two fragments are detected.

*PCR*: Using primers that anneal on either side of the polymorphic restriction site. After PCR, the products are treated with the appropriate restriction enzyme and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. If the site is ABSENT, then one band is seen on the agarose gel; if the site is present, then two bands are seen.

**SSLPs and how they are typed**: The sequence is amplified by PCR and the size is determined by either agarose gel or by a capillary column. The capillary column is favored because it is highly automated.




## What is the basis for Southern hybridization? Can this technique be used for other purposes?

**Southern hybridization** uses a probe that spans the polymorphic restriction site. The basis is that many fragments are made by digesting DNA material with enzymes, then separate this on a agarose gel. A nylon membrane with DNA probes are then put onto the gel, and the fragments migrate to the nylon membrane. The fragments that match the DNA probes that are on the membrane will attach itself to it, singling out fragments.

## What can DNA chips be used for?

DNA chips can be used for detecting many, many **SNPs** at once. A 2 square cm plate can detect up to 300 000 SNPs at once using 300 000 different oligonucleotides as probes.

## What is the process key to figuring out genes for human diseases and such?

The process of figuring out the gene sequence when a function is known
