**1. Why is an eukaryotic genome much more complex than a prokaryotic genome?**

*Eukaryotic* genomes are full of non-coding DNA, called introns. These introns are found in a greater amount that the coding DNA, exons, and are location in between these exons. This acts as a protection against restriction enzymes for the exons, but making the genetic information more complex.

*Prokaryotic* genome does not contain introns. So the genetic information is readily available for translation, without extra hassle of having to cut away non-coding information and rearranging exons.

The reason why this is?


**2. The PAH gene is 90 kb long and codes for a mature mRNA of 2.4 kb. Why is the gene so
much longer?**

The PAH gene is a gene from a eukaryotic organism where the functionality of the gene is wrapped in much non-coding DNA, introns. In the process of transcribing the whole gene is written out, full with its introns. This pre-mRNA must undergo further rounds of processing for the protein to attain its desired functionality. After modifying the gene by cutting away introns, ligating back exons in the right places and setting it with promoter and a mRNA characteristic poly-A tail, it is then ready to be processed by a ribosome into a functioning protein.

**3. In the experiments of Avery, MacLeod, and McCarthy, what was the purpose of treating
the transforming extract with two different enzymes?**

The experiment needed to figure out whether genes were stored in RNA and proteins or in DNA. When the mouse was treated with a RNase and proteinase, it died, showing that the information that transforms a harmless bacteria to a virulent one was something else than RNA or proteins. What was that something else? They put some other enzyme, DNase, together with the harmless bacteria and surely the mouse survived. This showed that DNA carried the information, the genes, that was necessary for the transformation principle to work.

**4. Given the following mRNA sequence _AUG AGA GCU CCG_**

*4. a) derive the DNA strand, the tRNA and make the protein that is encoded by this message.*

*4. b) How many hydrogen bonds would be present in the DNA segment?*

DNA: ATG AGA GCT CCG - Hydrogenbonds: 31
mRNA: AUG AGA GCU CCG
tRNA: AUG AGA GCU CCG
protein: **Met-Arg-Ala-Pro**
 **Methionine-Arginine-Alanine-Proline**

**5.What are recombination hot spots, which problems do they cause and how do they
originate?**

Recombination hot spots are areas on a chromosome that has repetitive sequences of Adenine and Thymine. Thymine and Adenine are bound together by hydrogen bonds, but they have only two hydrogen bonds compared to three between Guanine and Cytosine. This bonding of a double hydrogen is weaker and more exposed to breaking of their bond and hence mutations.


**6. Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a human genetic disorder caused by a recessive allele. A couple
plan to have children and come to you for counseling. They want to know the probability if
they will have an affected child. With your background in Mendelian inheritance, what can
you tell them, if**

*6.a. both are normal, but each has one affected parent and the other parent has no family
history of SCA.*

1/4 probability to get the recessive allele


*6.b. the man is affected by the disease, but the woman has no family record of SCA.*

0 probability to get the recessive allele

7. Explain why a population carries more genetic diversity than an individual.

The gene pool of a population is far greater than an individual and will be more diverse because there will be more possibilities through recombination and mutations.

8. How is linkage analysis used to construct genetic maps?

Linkage analysis is based on the assumption that the further apart two genes are on two homologous chromosomes, the higher the frequency of the recombination.

Distance between genes are expressed in **map units**: One map unit is the distance between two genes that recombine with a frequency of 1%.

9. Explain, why mapping is still an important feature for genome sequencing.



10. Describe briefly different types of markers used to construct genetic maps, and mention
some advantages or disadvantages.

DNA markers are:

- **RFLPs**: restriction fragment length polymorphism

This is a marker that exploits the differences between two homologous DNA sequences. Two homologous DNA segments are cut with restriction enzymes, and these differences/non-differences are displayed using a laboratory technique.

- **SSLPs**: simple sequence length polymorphism

SSLPs are repeated small sequence that vary in length.

- **SNPs**: single nucleotide polymorphism

11. Describe, what is the fundamental difference between the expression of a trait that is
determined by polygenes and the expression of a trait determined monogentically.



12. You are a molecular biology scientist travelling with some friends in South America.
During your journey, one of your travelling accompanies gets stomach problems. None of
the antibiotics or other medication you have taken with you is working properly (other
diseases like appendix or cancer could be excluded by examination at the regional hospital).
Some local people offer you to eat a certain kind of beetle, which is known by them to help
against stomach problems. Despite all of our suspicious, your friend takes the beetle and, to
your release, recovers after a couple of days. Since you are a molecular scientist, you are
curious, what might be the substance, which cured your friend.
12.a. How would you proceed to examine the genome of that beetle?
12.b. How could you compare the genome of that beetle to genomes of other beetles?
12.c. You have found an interesting substance, which you think might be a new antibiotics.
How may you test that in the lab?
12.d. Has your friend taken a risk? Why or why not? What could be the consequences?

13. Go to the UCSC genome browser, continue at the European site, search for human
information in version 38 (hg38), and find the PAH gene.
13.a. Where is the gene located?
13.b. Is it a protein coding gene? In which organ is it highest expressed?
13.b. Provide the RefSeq and/or Ensembl gene ID?
13.c. Use the common settings. Out form the information on the display, is a homologous
gene present in elephants?
13.d. Use the microsatellite mask ("full"). Are there microsatellites present in the gene? If
yes, which one?
13.e. Is the gene relevant for any disease? If yes, which one?
14. Previously, investigating the transcriptome was based on mRNA probes. This is no longer
up to date. Why?



15. The group of Craig Venter has created synthetic life forms. They try to build the genome
of a bacterium from scratch and incorporate it into a cell to make what they call the world's
first synthetic life form.
15.a. What do you think, which general parts (genes) of a genome are essential and have
been transferred?
15.b. So far, the bacterium is still based on an existing bacterium, guess why?
15.c. Craig Venter describes these experiments as "a defining moment in biology"; however,
many, and not only religious groups, are concerned. What may be the reason for it?
15.d. To meet these concerns, the single-cell organism has four "watermarks" written into its
DNA to identify it as synthetic and help to trace it descendants back to their creator. Which
sequences may they have been used?
