# Questions for the colloquium lecture 8

#### Which are the main components of ribosomes?

A **ribosome** is a protein synthesizer and it is a RNA-protein complex. Its components are called ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which catalyze chemical reactions such as linking two amino acids by peptide bonding.

Eukaryotic ribosomes are bigger than prokaryote's ribosome. Eukaryotic ribosomes have 3 rRNAs, prokaryotes have 2.

The ribosomes exist having one small subunit and one large subunit

#### What are the main two tasks of ribosomes?

**Coordinating** protein synthesis, by making sure that the tRNA, mRNA and proteins are placed in their correct position.

**Catalyzing** chemical reactions, such as peptide bonding so that two amino acids hold together.

Ribosomes are also part of repairing nucleotide damages

#### Protein synthesis, what happens during initiation, elongation and termination stage?

**Initiation**: Start codon is AUG at 5' end of mRNA.
- In bacteria, the initiatior tRNA carries formylated methionine (fMET)
- In eukaryotes, the initiatior tRNA carries methionine (MET).

The small ribosomal subunit binds to the 5' end cat of the mRNA and migrates to the AUG codon of the mRNA. The tRNA (in eukaryotes) carries the Methionine to the start codon, and the large subunit binds, making up the complex.

**Elongation**: Amino acids are added to growing polypeptides.

- Ribosomes moves in 5' end to 3' end direction along mRNA.

Elongation stage adds amino acids to the C-terminus of the polypeptide. Meaning the N-terminal at methionine is not configured during synthesis.

Charged tRNAs goes into the A site of the rRNA-protein complex.

**Termination**: Polypeptide synthesis stops at the 3' end reading frame.

- Recognition of nonsense codon.
- Polypeptide synthesis halted by release factors
- Release of polypeptide, ribosome and mRNA.

No normal tRNA carries the anticodon for the stop codon. A release factor binds to the stop codon of the mRNA, which release the subunits, mRNA and the polypeptide from each other.  

### Proteins are not active after synthesis. Proteins need to undergo further modifications to become active.


#### What are chaperons and what is their objection?

**Chaperones** are proteins that help newly synthesized proteins fold into their structure. Two most known chaperones are ;

- Hsp70 chaperones (=DnaK protein)
- Chaperonins

They do not specify structure, but help proteins to find its structure.

#### Find examples of post-translational protein modifications

**Methylation**: Modification of histone. Lysine is modified by the addition of methyl.

**Acetylation**: Modification of histone. Lysine is modified by and addition of acetyl.

**Phosphorylation**: Serine, Threonine, Tyrosine are modified by the addition of a phosphor-group, and proteins modified have something to do with signal transduction.  

#### Which methods may be applied to study proteins?

Ways to study proteins:

**Protein profiling**: Identifying protein composition

**Protein functions**: Identifying proteins that interact with one another.

**Protein profiling**:
- Before studying the proteome composition, the individual proteins needs to be separated. This can be done with a 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis. The first dimension separates proteins based on their isoelectric point, and the second dimension separates by their molecular size.

- Another separation can be done through **reverse-phase liquid chromatography**, where proteins are separated through a column based on their interaction with the solid phase in that column.

- Another separation can be done with **Ion-exchange chromatography** which separates proteins according to their net electric charges.

- The identification of proteins can be done with mass spectroscopy. MALDI-TOF seems to be popular.

**Protein functions**:

There are several methods for studying protein-protein interactions. Two most important are:

- **Phage display**:
For this a special type of cloning vector is used. It is based on lambda bacteriophage. The vector is designed so that when a new gene is inserted, it is expressed in such a way that its protein product becomes fused with one of the phage coat proteins.

Why the hell would you fuse it with a coat protein anyway? what's the deal?

Doing so makes the inserted gene able to interact with other proteins that the phage encounters.

- **Yeast two-hybrid system**:
Transcription factors are responsible for the expression of genes in eukaryotes (this method is based on eukaryote). And this method makes use of yeast cells that LACK a transcription factor for a reporter gene. The gene is therefore switched off. An artificial gene that codes for the DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor is ligated to the gene for the protein whose interactions we wish to study. After introduction into the yeast, this construct specifies synthesis for a **fusion protein** made up of the DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor attached to the human protein.

- **Protein array** can also be used, but the two forementioned techniques are the first choice.


#### Provide an example, Why it can be difficult to study protein expression



#### What are protein interaction maps?

Protein interaction maps are illustrations of connections a protein has to another protein. It illustrates what proteins is vital to cells survival and which proteins are non-lethal.

#### What is metabolomics?

Metabolomics is the study of the metabolome. The metabolome represents all the metabolites in a cell under a given circumstance.

#### Which questions may system biology be able to answer?

Systems biology seeks to understand better the biological functions a cell has. For example cancerous cells. Their biological processes are perturbed by the mutations they experience. Systems biology seeks to understand the resistance mechanisms and bypass mechanisms a cancerous cell might have to better detail a personalized treatment for a patient.

Systems biology is able to unveil connections and mechanisms that is not easily identified by human minds.
