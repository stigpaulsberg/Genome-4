# Questions for the colloquium lecture 3 (chapter 4 and 5)

### Which enzymes are used for cutting DNA and for amplification/synthesis of DNA?

These are *restriction enzymes*. Endo- and exonucleases.

### What is the reaction called, binding a DNA sequence to another?

Ligation?

### Cloning DNA, why contains the cloning vektor a resitant gene (e.g. against amicillin)?

The resistance gene is used as a marker. If a colony of transformants are grown on a agar plate containing amicillin, then only the clones will be able to survive there. Everything else that has not been transformed and contains a desired gene/trait will die.

### What is the principle of "running DNA on a gel"?

It's called gel electrophoresis, and this is a technique to separate DNA fragments based on their size. The polymer, the gel, is a material that shorter fragments have a easier way of getting forward than lenghtier fragments. This separates fragments of different sizes because of how fast they move throughout a material.


### Are there microarrays for DNA, RNA or both?



### What are the principal differences between chain-termination and next-generation sequencing?

### What are primers in a PCR reaction?

*Primers* in a PCR reaction are oligonucleotides which the polymerase will recognize, bind itself to, in order to start the synthesis of the complementary DNA thread. For DNA amplification.

### Why was next generations sequencing introduced?

### What is third and fourth generation sequencing?

### Which kind or sequencing may cause trouble for sequencing projects?

### What is the "exome"?

It is the coding variant of a gene. A gene consists of introns (*non coding information*) and exons (*coding information*). 


### What is "comparative genomics"?

### What may the untranslated regions (UTRs) be important for?

### What is the difference between a Southern and a Northern blot?
