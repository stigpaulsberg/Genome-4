## MAPPING Genomes

A genome map indicates positions and interesting features of genes and DNA sequences. There are two complementary approaches:

- **Genetic mapping** or **linkage analysis** is based on the use of genetic techniques like planned breeding experiments and examination of pedigrees (lineage, family tree).

- **Physical mapping** which uses biology techniques to examine DNA molecules directly to identify positions of sequence features including genes.

## Why is a genome map important?

The sequencing of DNA has a major limitation. Only with the most advanced methods are we able to sequence only 750 bp in a single experiment. This means that long sequences needs several experiments. One long equals many small. This is the **shotgun method**.
