## What can homologous genes and their origin tell us about the molecular processes involved in evolution?

Homologous genes are genes that share a **common evolutionary ancestor**.
There are two different types of homologies:
*Orthologous genes* are genes that are present in different organisms but have similar or the same function.
*Paralogous genes* are genes that are present in the same organism, as a duplication or a multigene family.

Homologous genes can tell us who we share a evolutionary past with and how/where we parted ways?

Homology searches makes use of the similarities between **sequences**
If a newly sequences gene is similar to a previously sequenced gene a **evolutionary relationship** can be the case. The function of the new gene is then *likely* to be the same or similar for the previous gene.

One way of doing homology searches is through the BLAST technique.

**BLAST** - Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. This is an algorithm for comparing amino sequences of a protein or the base sequence of DNA. A BLAST search enables researchers to compare newly sequenced genes to databases and identify similarities between species. **For example**: A newly discovered gene in a mouse with unknown functionality was compared to the human genome to discover its workings through a BLAST search.

Homology can be described by 4 levels.

- DNA
- RNA
- Proteins
- Domains

Deduction of functional properties can be done through identifying motifs and domains.

**Domains are described below**

## From a genomic point of view are human and mice are quite similar - why are they still (so) different?

The differences will lie in what frequency a gene is expressed, where it is expressed and also how. Exons of a gene can be spliced up in many different manners giving rise to many functionally different proteins.

**General genomic differences**

Mouse | humans
----- | -----
20 chromosomes | 23 chromosomes
23000 genes | 21000 genes
2.7 * 10^6 genomic size | 3.2 * 10^6 genomic size

**Repetitive sequences**



**Comparative genomics**

Different chromosome numbers
Repetitive sequences.
Genes of the mouse and human can be
It is only exons, the coding part, that are relevant. Might be very similar when comparing the whole genome, but the exons and how they are spliced will differ. Making two different species.

## Two sequences  are illustrating large similarities at their DNA level, is it still necessary to check their homologies at the amino acid level?

Lack of homology is more apparent at the amino acid level than at the DNA level. Similarities at the DNA level without taking into account of the amino sequences will give a higher rate of homology than what is actually expressed. Meaning you get a false picture of homologous functionality.

## What may be the limitations of sequence alignment using the BLAST program?

A BLAST search is unreliable when the similarities are **less than 40%**.
It doesn’t take in account where sequences are in the genome. It just compares the sequences and not the **positioning** of the sequences on the genome.
Data that is already collected is **not** 100% fool proof and can be wrong, making new analysis based on this also wrong.

## What are protein domains and why are they important for the analysis of gene functions?

Definition: Domains are ***segments*** of a ***protein*** that possess a ***characteristic tertiary structure*** that provides the protein with a ***particular biochemical function***.

A segment of protein might be different in their amino sequence but still have similar functions.

What is a **domain**? Domains are distinct functional and/or structural units in a protein. They are usually responsible for a specific function or interaction, contributing to the overall protein role.

So it is a separate structure which can be evident in many different proteins. Domains are specific functions, for example hydrolysis or transporting, which is used to classify a protein.

An example of this is the zinc finder DNA binding protein.

## How to study gene functions using model organisms?

Gene functions are similar in different organisms. There are similar functions in mice and human. With mice we can do whatevs without hurting any butts.



## How to identify novel genes using model organisms and mutational analysis?

**Mutational analysis**: Mutational analysis is search in a mutant organism where the phenotype has become altered. One basically treat organism with different mutagens like radiation, chemical or t-DNA, UV-light.

## What is homologous recombination and how is it used to study gene expression?

Homologous recombination (destroy the gene) is used to create knock-out organisms. To study gene function and what is responsible for its functionality. Can also make a gene shorter, to investigate what sequence is doing what

## Why is RNAi not a homologous recombination technique?

RNAi: RNAinterference.
Ulempe for RNAi: it’s not 100% successful.

## Why may it important to study some genes by suppression and others by overexpression?

If for example you increase the expression of a gene. Does the organism experience any higher degree of mutations? maybe other symptoms that is not beneficial. The same with suppression, it is to see how frequency of expression is involved with how the organism works.
