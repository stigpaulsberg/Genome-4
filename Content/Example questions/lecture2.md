##### What are the three laws of Mendel?

**First law, Law of Dominance** - If a dominant allele is present it will show in the phenotype. If no dominant allele is present the recessive allele will show

**Second law, Law of Segregation** - This law states that a pair of alleles will be separated from each other during meiosis.
Segregation: "To separate or et apart from others from the main body"

**Third law, Law of Independent Assortment** - Alleles of one trait do not affect the allele of another trait. They separate independently. In other words the genes inherited from one chromosome is inherited independently of traits on another chromosome?

##### What are the major phases of mitosis and meiosis?

**Mitosis** - It is a process where diploid somatic cell divides to form two equal diploid daughter cells.

*Phases*:

- **Interphase** - The genetic material has not yet condensed and is still in a open configuration.

- **Late prophase** - After condensation, the chromosome have formed structures visible with the light microscope.

- **Metaphase** - During metaphase, the nuclear membrane breaks down and the chromosomes are lined up in the center of the cell.

- **Anaphase** - The microtubules now draw the daughter chromosomes toward either end of the cell.

- **Telophase** - In telophase. nuclear membranes re-form around each collection or separated daughter chromosome at each end. The result is that the parent nucleus has given rise to two identical daughter nuclei.



**Meiosis** - Process that occurs only in reproductive cells. It results in four haploid gametes (cells) where each gamete can fuse for sexual reproduction.

- **Interphase** - The chromosome is starting to form and after condensation, homologous pairs line up and form *bivalents* with other homologous pairs. In meiosis the pairs are not independent or separated as it is with mitosis.

- **Prophase 1** - In prophase 1 the bivalent has formed and crossing over might occur, involving breakage of chromosome arms and exchange of DNA.

- **Anaphase 1** - The two homologous pairs now separates (crossover of DNA might have happened and are now separated into either end of the cell). Nuclei are now formed around the separated chromosomes.

- **Prophase 2** - The forward process now resembles more that of mitosis. The chromosomes are now separated within a nuclei each. There are now two nuclei within the cell.

- **Metaphase 2** - The nuclei are now opened up again, and the homologous pairs are lined up.

- **Anaphase 2** - The homologous pairs are now separated by the microtubules. There are now four separate areas with genetic material.

- **Telophase 2** - 4 nuclei now form, each carrying a single copy of each chromosome. These are haploid cells. Diploid cells have chromosome pairs.

##### What is the principal difference between mitosis and meiosis?

The difference is that **meiosis** contributes to variations in a species. Meiosis is the cell cycle for a sexual reproductive cell.


##### What is genetic linkage?

Genetic linkage is the idea that **genes that are close together on a chromosome tend to be inherited together**

##### What is "junk DNA"?

"Junk DNA" is noncoding DNA that appears to have no biological function. Noncoding DNA can have gene regulatory function. Noncoding DNA that does not seem to have any biological function has been categorized as "junk DNA".

##### Which areas in the genome are difficult to map? Why?



##### What are the differences between genetic and physical maps?
##### Why was genetic mapping in humans difficult?
##### What are RFLPs, what are SSLPs, what SNPs? What can they be used for?
##### Which methods can be applied to detect and analyze SSLPs and RFLPs?
