# Questions for lecture 1

##### What are the principal differences between a prokaryote and a eukaryote cell?

Prokaryotes | Eukaryotes
---- | ----
One cell | Multi cellular
Without nucleus | Has a nucleus
Without organelles (but contains plasmids) | Has many different organelles
Contains one circular chromosome | Contains either one or more linear chromosomes
Simple organization. Has no pre-mRNA - meaning no post transcriptional modification | has exons and introns splicing mechanisms


##### Are there alternatives for the "central dogma in biology"?





##### What is a gene?

A gene is a storage unit for biological information. The information it contains are blueprints for proteins and shiet. "Sequence information to construct a particular protein".

A gene is a basic unit for heritage in living cells.

It carries information that passes to offspring.



##### why use different biological disciplines various definitions for "gene"?




##### Why were the sequencing projects not started earlier?



##### What are pseudogenes? Which processes may lead to pseudogenes?

Pseudogenes are genes that have lost their transcriptional function

"A pseudogene is a sequence of nucleotides that resembles a genuine gene but does not specify a functional RNA or protein". Pseudogenes comes from real, functional genes and can be viewed as a evolutionary relic.

**Processes that lead to change**

**Mutations**

In some cases, a gene turns into a pseudogene simply because of a mutation, changing it nucleotide sequence. Pseudogenes that arise from mutations like these are called **conventional** or **nonprocessed pseudogenes**. They fall into two broad classes:

- A **duplicated pseudogene** arises when a member of a multigene family becomes inactivated by mutation. This event usually does not harm the organism because other genes in the family are still active and the function that the pseudogene carried is not lost.

- **Unitary pseudogenes** also arise from mutation, but in this case the gene is not part of a multigene family. This means that the function of the now pseudogene is lost and not compensated for by other members of the family like in the one stated above. Unitary pseudogenes are rare because loss of a function is usually vital. This means death. This means the pseudogene can not be inherited.

**Process not involving mutation**

Other pseudogenes arise by a process not involving mutation. These are called **processed pseudogenes** and they result from an abnormal adjunct to gene expression. A processed pseudogene is a mRNA that is transcribed into a cDNA, and then reintegrated into the chromosome. Or possibly a different chromosome.

cDNA is a copy of the mRNA, so this does not contain any introns. It also lacks the code sequence immediately upstream of the parent gene which is the region in which the signals used to switch on expression of the parent gene are located. This in total means that the cDNA reinserted into the genome is inactive.

**A pseudogene is an inactive form of a parent gene. A pseudogene can arise through mutations, or by a mechanism called *processed pseudogene*. This is a reintegration of the cDNA into the genome at a different location, lacking signal system for expression and introns**


##### Which forms of mutations exist?

- **Point mutations** - a change of a single nucleotides
- **Deletion** - a deletion of a whole gene
- **Duplication** - a extra copy of a particular gene
- **Inversion** - a directional change of a gene
- **Insertion** - a portion of a chromosome inserted into a different chromosome
- **Translocation** - a "swap" of gene portions between chromosomes


##### Why is it believed that RNA was "first" / the beginning of life?

One idea that gives some basis to it is that RNA is something of an inbetweener of DNA and a protein. A DNA does not have much biological function other than storing information that can be translated into biological functions recognized via proteins. And proteins is not a storage for information, but a translation of information into biological function.

RNA is somewhere in between. RNA has a lot of biological function (ribosomes are made up of RNA and proteins, tRNA is a transporter of aminoacids) and it is also a storage unit for information (mRNA). RNA is however less stable, and seen through a "more stable wins the time race" eye-lense, the DNA would eventually take over RNA's position as a storage unit due to its higher chemical stability.

##### What is alternative splicing and why is it more present in vertebrates?

**Alternative splicing** is a gene modification mechanism which makes possible the translation of several different proteins derived from the same gene.

A gene contains introns and exons and the alternative splicing mechanism can modify the pre-mRNA to match up the exons of a gene into different combinations, giving rise to different proteins.

This is a efficient strategy due to the translation of several different genes can come from a smaller amount of information.

**Why are they more present in vertebrates?**

**Vertebrate** - An animal or large group distinguished by the possession of a backbone or spinal column, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish.

Alternative splicing is more present in vertebrates because????

Vertebrates are viewed as higher organisms, and a more prevalent alternative splicing indicate that alternative splicing is correlated with complexity of the organism.

##### What are housekeeping genes?

Housekeeping genes are genes that code for proteins that have biological functions that are performed in all cells.
