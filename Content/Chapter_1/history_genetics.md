# History of genetics
## 1869

The DNA was discovered by *Friedrich Miescher*, a swiss biochemist. The first extract Miescher made from human white blood cells were a crude mixture of DNA and proteins. He later succeeded in preparing a pure sample of nuclei acid from salmon sperm. He found that DNA was acidic and rich in phosphorous. It took 60 years until the length of the polymer chain was appreciated.

* It was first thought that proteins are the fundament of genes, because of its immense variability.

## 1903

*Walter Stanborough Sutton* came up with the **chromosome theory** in 1903. Examination of cells by **cytochemistry** showed that chromosomes are made out of proteins and DNA, in roughly equal amounts.

*Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty* showed that bacteria are made up of DNA. They showed this with a transformation experiment. They mixed bacterial cell extract with a harmless strain of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, and these bacterias converted into a virulent (actively poisonous) form. This caused pneumonia when injected into mice. This showed that transformation involves a transfer of genes.

*Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase* used radioactive labeling to show that when bacteria is infected by bacteriophages (virus), DNA is the major component that enter the bacterial cell. If DNA from the bacteriophages enters the cells, then it is clear that the genes of the bacteriophages are made up of DNA (not proteins). 

* Still think that genes was made up of proteins.

## 1951

*James Watson and Francis Crick* figured out the structure of DNA with - the double helix.
Watson and Crick proposed the double helix based on four key factors:

1. The water content of DNA fibers to establish the **density of the DNA in a fiber**.
This was crucial for figuring out if DNA was double or triple helix.

- **X-ray diffraction pattern** produced by **_Rosalind Franklin_** that revealed a detailed helical structure.

- **Base ratios** discovered by *Erwin Chargaff*.
He carried out lengthy chromatographic studies of DNA samples and showed that the amount of **guanine**, G, is equal to the amount of **cytosine**, C, and that **thymine**, T, equals amount of **adenine**, A.

- The only major technique that the super-duo performed themselves: The **scale model** of possible DNA structures.
It revolved around the relative position of the various atoms, such that formed chemical bonds were not too far apart and others not too close together.


 * This was actually a race for the two since there were other scientists proposing structures to the DNA.
DNA was thought to be a triple helix by some scientist based on wrong estimates of water content of DNA fibers.
