# Questions for the colloquium lecture 7



#### Describe one examples of a DNA binding motif?

DNA binding proteins are divided into families defined by the structure of their DNA binding motifs

**2 major families:**

- **Helix-turn-helix (HTH)**
- **Zinc fingers**

I will be describing the HTH motif.

**HTH binding motif**

- Present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
- The second helix binds to the **majro groove** of DNA, the *DNA recognition helix*
- Main motif consists of 20 amino acids
- Other parts of the protein attaches to the surface of DNA.

HTH is part of a homeodomain protein and that means it is important in the developmental regulation of genome expression

- Extended HTH with 60 aminoacids
- 3x a-Helix
- Helix 2 and 3 forms the HTH
- Helix 3 is the recognition Helix
- Helix 1 stabilizes the structure

#### Show some examples of noncoding RNA and their various functions?

Non coding RNA - 90% of it is not translated into proteins, but the majority is actively transcribed and a large fraction may be functional.

**Transcriptome - Noncoding RNAs**

*4 major categories*

1. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) - ribosome component
2. Transfer RNA (tRNA) - amino acid transporter during translation
3. Short noncoding RNA (sncRNA) < 200 bp
4. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) > 200 bp

##### Ribosomal RNAs

**RNA-polymerase 1, 2 and 3.**


##### **Short noncoding RNA (sncRNA) < 200 bp**
Short noncoding RNA can have diverse functions.

tRNA was discovered in 1958, and it is a sncRNA.

**Small nuclear RNA (snRNA)** are present in the nucleus and are rich in Uracil.
- Can form complexes with ribonucleoproteins
- Others build the spliceosome in the speckles.

**Small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)** are located in the nucleoli, inside the nucleus.
These participate in the chemical modification of rRNAs.

**RNAs outside the nucleus are involved in RNA silencing**.

- *Short interfering RNA (siRNA)* - 20-25 nucleotides.
- Result in *silencing* of particular mRNAs
- *MicroRNAs (miRNAs)* are similar to siRNAs
- Participate in RNA interfering
- *PiwiRNA (piRNA)* - 25-30 nt long.
- Associate with piwi proteins
- Participate in gene repression.

sncRNA is also a constituent of the telomerase, the protein that prolongs the chromosomal ends.

##### Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)

These RNA covers a large portion of the intergenic areas of the human genome.
There are over 50 000 lncRNAs in the human genome
- They are often cell type specific
- They come in low copy numbers
- Some are found in intergenic regions
  - long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA)

Assigning function to lncRNA is difficult.

Panda is a decoy of a lncRNA. It works by making a transcription factor bind to the PANDA lncRNA instead of a gene, thereby hindering gene expression.

Some lncRNA named Xist and Tsix RNAs mediate the x inactivation in female mammals.

A higher copy number of one lncRNA has been associated with prostate cancer, and some other with breast cancer.

LncRNA are also involved in histone modification and the chromatin state eu-/heterochromatin.




#### How may long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression?

**Long non-coding RNA**: A noncoding RNA longer than 200 nucleotides in length.

lncRNA are involved in histone modification and chromatin states.

Transcriptional interference. It induces chromatin remodeling and histone modifications.

#### Which major types of RNA polymerases exist and what are their functions?

Polymerase | Types of RNAs
--- | ----
RNA polymerase 1 | 28S, 5.8S, 18S rRNAS
RNA polymerase 2 | mRNA, Sm family of snRNAs, some snoRNAs, siRNA, miRNA, piRNA, lncRNA
RNA polymerase 3 | tRNAs, 55 rRNAs, some snoRNAs.
Polymerase | function
RNA polymerase 1 |

Their function is to synthesize RNA in 5' -> 3' direction.

#### How are activators and repressors influencing transcription?

**Repressors** influence gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylases and methyl transferases.

**Activators** influence gene expression by recruitment of histone acetyl transferase


#### What is mRNA processing?

It is a processing of mRNA where mRNA gets modified so that it can be transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasma. The modifications are:

- Capping, where it modifies the 5' end of a mRNA molecule
- Polyadenylering, the newly transcribed mRNA gets adenyled in its 3' end, the poly A tail.

It is all done so that it can be transfered from the nucleus to the cytoplasma and making the mRNA more stable

#### What are the forms and features of alternative splicing?

There are four forms:

**1. Exon Skipping**:

This alternative is also viewed as a mistake during splicing, where a exon is skipped. When splicing together other exons. Donor and acceptor site are largely the same for all introns. Mistakes are thought to occur and that the wrong splice sites could be joined, leaving a exon out of the mature RNA.

**2. Alternative site selection**:

The usual donor and acceptor site is ignored and a second site is used.

**3. Alternative exons**:

The mRNA contains one or the other exon, but not both at the same time.

**4. Intron retention**:

An intron that is usually spliced out is retained in the mature RNA.

#### What are the major steps in a microarray expression experiment?

What are microarrays ?

Microarray = Array = Probe array = chip

- Arrays of numerous pre-immobilized probes on a solid surface representing various genes of some biological species.

- Arrays enable parallel analysis of complex samples

- By scanning, the amount of cDNA/DNA/protein bound to the spots on the microarrays is precisely measured, generating a profile of gene expression (RNA/cDNA), genome profile (DNA) or protein20.

**What are the major steps in a microarray expression experiment?**

The major steps of a comparative hybridization experiment are:

0. Choosing cell populations: **Experimental design**
1. **RNA extraction** (total RNA or mRNA)
2. **Reverse transcription (cDNA)** and **labeling**
3. **Hybridization** to a microarray
4. **Scanning** of the hybridized array
5. Interpreting of the scanned image: **Analysis**

#### What is clustering?

Clustering is a sort of grouping of genes or samples that are highly correlated. Clusters are formed to reduce complexity and base inferences on molecular expressional patterns. 

#### What can we measure applying chips and arrays?
