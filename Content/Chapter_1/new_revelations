# New revelations
## This is the stupid part of me revealed.

**DNA structure**: There are more than one form of DNA.
There are three different ones called *A-DNA, B-DNA and Z-DNA*.
The structure that Crick and Watson proposed is the B-DNA.

**Hydrogen bonds** are actually not that strong. A typical bond energy is 8-29 kJ/mol compared to a covalent bond energy of 348 kJ/mol at 25 degrees celsius.
Think about diamond boiling point compared to water. Duh...
