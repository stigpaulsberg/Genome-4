## GENOME EXPRESSION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CELL AND ORGANISM

*The genome must be able to respond and adapt to changes in its environment. Changes that can be hormones or growth factors. The response of the genome to these extracellular signals is usually transient: the expression pattern reverts to its original form when the signals cease or takes on a new pattern if one set of signals is replaced by a second set.*

*Other changes in the genome activity that are permanent or semipermanent lead to changes called **differentiation**: the adoption by the cell of a specialized physiological role.*

*Assembly and modification of complex multicellular structures over time constitutes the **development** pathway for the organism.*

Underlying all these processes is the regulation of the genome expression, which has been a constant theme in our discussion of the transcriptome and proteome during the previous two chapters.

## 14.1 THE RESPONSE OF THE GENOME TO EXTERNAL signals

To exert an effect on genome activity, the nutrient, hormone, growth factor, or other extracellular compound that represents the external signal must influence events within the cell. There are two ways in which it can do this:

- Directly, by **acting as a signaling compound** that is transported across the cell membrane and into the cells

- Indirectly, by **binding to a cell surface receptor** that transmits a signal into the cell.

So: Either be a signal compound, or bind to a signal receptor.

Signal transmission is one of the major research areas in cell biology, with high focus on abnormalities related to cancer.

### Signal transmission by import of the extracellular signaling compound
