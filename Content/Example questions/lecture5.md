# Questions for the colloquium lecture 5

#### Which parts / structures build the histones?

Histones are small, *positively charged*, and very conserved proteins.

The histones are built by 5 proteins. These proteins are called H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.

Histones are part of a structure called a **nucleosome**, and the proteins H2A, H2B, H3 AND H4 makes up a complex called a histone octamer. Around this positively charged octamer, the DNA of about 150 bp is wrapped around. And in between these nucleosomes are **linker DNA** of about 50-70 bp length, connecting these nucleosomes like *pearls on a string*.

Each histone protein has a long, unstructured, N-terminal tail which can be modified chemically to alter gene expression levels.

#### How is DNA condensed?

The condensation of DNA is a three level condensing called:

- **Nucleosome**: This is a tightening of the "beads-on-a-string" structure where the nucleosomes comes close together.

- **Supercoiling**: This is a coiling of the tightly packed nucleosomes to form spirals. There are two different hypothetical structures for the spiraling:

 1. The solenoid model
 2. The helical ribbon model.


- **Radical loop-scaffold**: This is the fibers formed from supercoiling folded into loops for even more tight packaging.

#### What is the difference between heterochromatin and euchromatin?

**Heterochromatin** - These are regions of the chromosome that is condensed and the genetic material is not thought to be ready for transcription.

**Euchromatin** - These are regions of a eukaryotic chromosomes that are relatively uncondensed, where the genetic material is readily available for transcription

#### Why are the telomeres getting shorter?

**Telomere** - The end of a eukaryotic chromosome.

**Telomerase** - The enzyme that maintains the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes by synthesizing telomeric repeat sequences.

**Telomeric repeat sequence** - Telomeric DNA is made up of hundreds of these sequences, these copies of repeated motifs. The motif is:

** 5'-TTAGGG-3' ** in humans

*Why are these repeated sequences getting shorter?*

Each time a somatic cell divides, the tandem repeats of telomeres shorten. The telomeres is a recognition site for a cell. It enables the cell to distinguish between a natural end from a unnatural end caused by chromosome breakage.

To uphold the length of these telomeres, a enzyme to synthesize back the ends that was lost during division needs to be present, called **Telomerase**. In cancer cells, sex cells and stem cells these are expressed in a high frequency.

In somatic cells however this is not the case. Somatic cells have a low expression level of the telomerase that repairs the chromosome ends.

***The repeated sequences at the end of chromosomes are getting shorter because the expression level of telomerase in somatic cells are low, therefore a repair of these sequences is not completed at the same level as in a stem, cancerous or sex cell (**which can proliferate indefinitely***).***

#### What is the relationship between size and complexity of a genome?

Genome size increases with complexity, but this is by all means not a linear relationship.

#### Are gene distributed evenly within a genome?

**No**

1. Evidence: The banding pattern that forms when dying the chromosomes. Cytogeneticists predicted that there would be fewer genes in dark G-bands because genes generally have AT contents of 45-50%. The human genome as a whole has about 60% A+T content.

2. Evidence: Several human chromosomes contains gene deserts, where the gene density is low over several Mbp pairs.

#### Which differences exist between the genomes of yeast, fruit fly, and humans?

**Human genome** - The human genome is very complex, comprised of many LINEs, SINEs, LTR elements and DNA transposons. 

**Yeast genome** - The yeast genome is more packed and has a higher gene density than the fruit fly and human genome. The yeast genome has fewer interspersed spaces between the coding genes.

**Fruit fly genome** - The fruit fly genome is more complex than the yeast genome, but less so than the human. It has more interspersed sequences and less gene density.

#### What is the advantage of alternative splicing?
#### How may long non-coding RNAs influence gene expression?
#### How are microsatellites used in genetic profiling?
