# Questions for the colloquium lecture 3 (chapter 4 and 5)

### Which enzymes are used for cutting DNA and for amplification/synthesis of DNA?

These are *restriction enzymes*. Endo- and exonucleases. - for cutting DNA. For amplification it is polymerase.

### What is the reaction called, binding a DNA sequence to another?

Hybridization is the name for it. Ligation is connecting one ssDNA to another.

### Cloning DNA, why contains the cloning vektor a resitant gene (e.g. against amicillin)?

The resistance gene is used as a marker. If a colony of transformants are grown on a agar plate containing amicillin, then only the clones will be able to survive there. Everything else that has not been transformed and contains a desired gene/trait will die.

### What is the principle of "running DNA on a gel"?

It's called gel electrophoresis, and this is a technique to separate DNA fragments based on their size. The polymer, the gel, is a material that shorter fragments have a easier way of getting forward than lenghtier fragments. This separates fragments of different sizes because of how fast they move throughout a material.


### Are there microarrays for DNA, RNA or both?

A microarray is a laboratory tool used to detect the expression of thousands of genes at the same time. THere are microarrays for both. It is a hybridiation of expressed DNA.

### What are the principal differences between chain-termination and next-generation sequencing?

Chain-termination is the dideoxynucleotide method.

next-generation sequencing has many methods, but principal is the same.

* It is rapid and costly, it sequences many thousand copies at a time.

* The first step is to create a DNA library.

* It has a massively parallel array format.

* DNA fragments are short, ranging from 100 to 500 bp.

* It breaks the DNA into random fragments

* The amplification happens on immobilized DNA-fragments (by oligonucleotides).

* It is cheaper, faster and has the possibility of being automatic.

### What are primers in a PCR reaction?

*Primers* in a PCR reaction are oligonucleotides which the polymerase will recognize, bind itself to, in order to start the synthesis of the complementary DNA thread. For DNA amplification.

### Why was next generations sequencing introduced?

DNA sequencing produces errors in the DNA fragments. Having multiple copies of a fragment is very useful to eliminate the problems of the DNA synthesis errors.
To become cheaper, quicker and automated.

Next generations sequencing needs a delay between each single step / nucleotide addition.

### What is third and fourth generation sequencing?

Third generation sequencing: This is a sequencing technique that is based on


Fourth generation - Nanopore sequencing.


### Which kind of sequencing may cause trouble for sequencing projects?

Prokaryotes are easier to sequence than eukaryote. Because eukaryotes have many repetitive sequences, centromers and a lot of introns.


### What is the "exome"?

It is the coding variant of a gene. A gene consists of introns (*non coding information*) and exons (*coding information*). Everything that gets transcribed from DNA to RNA.


### What is "comparative genomics"?

The technique of using other organisms to sequence something????


### What may the untranslated regions (UTRs) be important for?





### What is the difference between a Southern and a Northern blot?

THe Norhtern blot detects TARGET RNA. Southern blot detects TARGET DNA.
