# Questions for the colloquium lecture 6

#### How are eukaryotic organellar genomes structured?

The structure of organellar genomes give evidence for the endosymbiotic theory.

Eukaryotic organellar gene expression processes are similar to the same processes in prokaryotes.

Organellar genes are also more similar to genes in prokarotes than to eukaryotes.

**Characteristics**:

- The genomes of organelles are mostly circular (with some exceptions in chloroplast).
- Copy number varies between organisms.
- All mitochondrion genomes contain at least some protein *components of the respiratory chain*, the biochemical feature of mitochondrion.

#### What comprehends the endosymbiont theory?

[Videoclip describing the theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQFgT-LUbAQ)

The endosymbiotic theory explains that eukaryotic cells formed teams with prokaryotic cells. The evidence that supports this are that the genomic material that the mitochondrion has is much alike the genetic material a prokaryotic cell has. It is circular, small and the genes are more alike the genes of prokaryotes than eukaryotes.

#### What are mitochondria and what is their function?

The mitochondria is thought to be a prokaryotic cell which merged with eukaryotic cells. The mitochondria is a power-house of the cell, creating ATP for all the energy needing biological processes. It creates ATP at its cristae in the cell, through the pathway of electron transport chain.

#### How is mitochondrial DNA inherited?

Mitochondrial DNA is mostly inherited maternally. Mitochondrial DNA is therefor **non-Mendelian**. If the father is affected by a mitochondrial disease, its offspring's chance of inheriting that disease is close to zero.

#### What are the differences between euchromatin and heterochromatin?

Euchromatin is open for business and can readily be transcripted. Heterochromatin is relatively condensed and DNA-binding proteins cannot easily access the chromatin at this state.

#### Which chemical histone modifications exist?

1. Methylation
2. Acetylation
3. Phosphorylation.

#### What is histone acetylation / de- acetylation and which enzymes are involved?

**Histone acetylation/de-acetylation** is a mechanism done by big multiprotein complexes that is linked to DNA packaging and the activation/de-activation of genes.

**Acetylation**: the enzymes involved in the acetylation are **histone acetyltransferase (HATs)**. They are not alone in the acetylation but are part of a bigger multiprotein complex.

**De-acetylaton**: The enzymes involved in this are also part of a bigger multiprotein complex, but the main protein discussed are the **histone deacetylase (HDACs)**.

#### What is nucleosome repositioning and how can it influences gene expression?

**Nucleosome repositioning** gives DNA-binding proteins access to attachment sites. **Remodeling** is not a covalent alteration to histone molecules. It is rather a energy-dependent process that weakens the contact between the nucleosome and the DNA associated with it. There are three types of changes that can occur:

**Remodeling**: This is a change in the general structure of the nucleosome, but not a repositioning. When the remodeling is done *in vitro* the nucleosome gains double the size and an increased DNase sensitivity.

**Sliding**: or ***cis***-**displacement** physically moved the nucleosome along the DNA.

**Trasnfer**: or ***trans***-**displacement** results in the nucleosome being transferred to a second DNA molecule.

These changes are involved in the sensitivity of the DNA to the DNase. And also making the attachment sites for DNA-binding proteins accessible.

#### How is DNA methylated and what is the purpose of it?

**DNA Methylation** are changes that are associated with semi-permanent silencing of gene-regions. These methylations are carried out by **DNA methyltransferases**.

The methylation pattern **is not random**. Instead it is limited to the cytosine in some copies of the sequences 5'-CG-3' and, in plants, 5'-CNG-3'. There are *two types of methylation activity*.

The first is **maintenance methylation**. This happens after genome replication. It is responsible for adding methyl groups to the newly synthesized strand of DNA at positions opposite methylated of parent strand. This ensures that two daughter strands are identical to its parent.

The second is ** *de novo* methylation** which adds methyl groups at *totally new positions* and so changes the pattern of methylation in a localized region of the genome.

**Both of these methylations results in a repression of gene activity.**

#### What is genomic imprinting?

Genomic imprinting is a form of **DNA methylation**. This is a feature in which only one pair of genes, present on homologous chromosomes in a diploid nucleus, is expressed while the second is silenced by *methylation*.

**X inactivation** is a form of imprinting to almost total inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in a female mammalian cell. If both the X chromosomes in females were expressed then proteins might be synthesized at twice the rate compared to males.**Acetylation**:
