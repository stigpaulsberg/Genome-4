# Overview - Chapter 1
## Genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes



The human genome consist of nuclear genome and mitochondrial genome.

*The nuclear* genome are 24 chromosomes = 22 autosomes + x and y chromosome. Approx 3 235 000 000 bp of DNA and we have around 45 500 genes present in this genome.
*The mitochondrial* genome is a circular DNA molecule of 17000 base pairs and there are 10 copies of it. This codes for 37 genes in total.


### Definitions
---
**Somatic cells**: Any cell of a living organism that is not a reproductive cell. Not so sexy cell.

**Haploid**: Haploid cells are generates after meiosis when the number of chromosomes are halved. These are sex cells. Need two of these, one from female and one from male to form offspring.

**Diploid**: Any cell containing two copies of each autosome plus two sex chromosomes.

### Summary

The higher the organism, the higher amount of basepairs are found in its genome. This however does not correlate with number of chromosomes. A carpe (fish) has a number of 104 chromosomes, but the homo sapiens have only 46. Why?

- **The genome** is the store of biological information, and this is shared by **every** organism on the planet.

- Nearly all organisms store their information in DNA. The exception to this rule are virus, which can store their genes in **RNA** molecules.

- **Genome expression** is the process where information (DNA) is transported out to the cell (expressed).

- The first product of the genome is **transcriptome**. This is the step where DNA gets translated into all the RNA (tRNA, mRNA, rRNA) of the genes that are **active at a partiular time**.

- The second product of the genomes is the database of proteins, the **proteome**. This is the repertoire of biochemical *functions* that the cells is able to carry out.

- DNA was first obtained in 1945-1952 but wasn't accepted until Crick and Watson in 1953 showed the structure of the DNA based on basepair ratios, Franklinds x-ray diffraction, +++ more.

- A *DNA polynucleotide* is an unbranched polymer that contains a phosphate group and sugar molecule as its backbone, with four chemically different nucleotides.

- The *DNA double helix* can have several forms. A-DNA, B-DNA and the zig-zag form Z-DNA.

- RNA is also a polynucleotide but the individual nucleotides have **different** structures compared to DNA. RNA is also usually single-stranded.

- All cells contains various forms of DNA, including coding RNA (mRNA) and non-coding (tRNA, rRNA).

- Proteins are also unbranched polymers, but their sequence is made up from amino acids, not nucleotides.

- The **amino sequence** is the *primary* structure of polypeptides/proteins and secondary, tertiary, quaternaty being the foldings and conformation the protein are formed from.

- Proteins are functionally diverse, because they can be cut and mixed together to form a variety of structures with different functionality. When **combined in different ways**, the proteins produce a range of chemical features.

- Proteins are synthesized by translation of the mRNA. The mRNA is a polynucleotide and one amino acid is translated from three nucleotide, a codon. One triplet codes for one amino acid.

- The genetic code **is not** universal. Variations of the genetic code (translation of mRNA to amino acids) are found in *mitochondria and in lower eukaryotes*, and some codons can have two different meanings in a single gene.
