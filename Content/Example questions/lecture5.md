# Questions for the colloquium lecture 5

#### Which parts / structures build the histones?

Histones are small, *positively charged*, and very conserved proteins.

The histones are built by 5 proteins. These proteins are called H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.

Histones are part of a structure called a **nucleosome**, and the proteins H2A, H2B, H3 AND H4 makes up a complex called a histone octamer. Around this positively charged octamer, the DNA of about 150 bp is wrapped around. And in between these nucleosomes are **linker DNA** of about 50-70 bp length, connecting these nucleosomes like *pearls on a string*.

Each histone protein has a long, unstructured, N-terminal tail which can be modified chemically to alter gene expression levels.

#### How is DNA condensed?

The condensation of DNA is a three level condensing called:

- **Nucleosome**: This is a tightening of the "beads-on-a-string" structure where the nucleosomes comes close together.

- **Supercoiling**: This is a coiling of the tightly packed nucleosomes to form spirals. There are two different hypothetical structures for the spiraling:

 1. The solenoid model
 2. The helical ribbon model.


- **Radical loop-scaffold**: This is the fibers formed from supercoiling folded into loops for even more tight packaging.

#### What is the difference between heterochromatin and euchromatin?

**Heterochromatin** - These are regions of the chromosome that is condensed and the genetic material is not thought to be ready for transcription.

**Euchromatin** - These are regions of a eukaryotic chromosomes that are relatively uncondensed, where the genetic material is readily available for transcription

#### Why are the telomeres getting shorter?

**Telomere** - The end of a eukaryotic chromosome.

**Telomerase** - The enzyme that maintains the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes by synthesizing telomeric repeat sequences.

**Telomeric repeat sequence** - Telomeric DNA is made up of hundreds of these sequences, these copies of repeated motifs. The motif is:

** 5'-TTAGGG-3' ** in humans

*Why are these repeated sequences getting shorter?*

Each time a somatic cell divides, the tandem repeats of telomeres shorten. The telomeres is a recognition site for a cell. It enables the cell to distinguish between a natural end from a unnatural end caused by chromosome breakage.

To uphold the length of these telomeres, a enzyme to synthesize back the ends that was lost during division needs to be present, called **Telomerase**. In cancer cells, sex cells and stem cells these are expressed in a high frequency.

In somatic cells however this is not the case. Somatic cells have a low expression level of the telomerase that repairs the chromosome ends.

***The repeated sequences at the end of chromosomes are getting shorter because the expression level of telomerase in somatic cells are low, therefore a repair of these sequences is not completed at the same level as in a stem, cancerous or sex cell (**which can proliferate indefinitely***).***

#### What is the relationship between size and complexity of a genome?

Genome size increases with complexity, but this is by all means not a linear relationship.

#### Are gene distributed evenly within a genome?

**No**

1. Evidence: The banding pattern that forms when dying the chromosomes. Cytogeneticists predicted that there would be fewer genes in dark G-bands because genes generally have AT contents of 45-50%. The human genome as a whole has about 60% A+T content.

2. Evidence: Several human chromosomes contains gene deserts, where the gene density is low over several Mbp pairs.

#### Which differences exist between the genomes of yeast, fruit fly, and humans?

**Human genome** - The human genome is very complex, comprised of many LINEs, SINEs, LTR elements and DNA transposons.

**Yeast genome** - The yeast genome is more packed and has a higher gene density than the fruit fly and human genome. The yeast genome has fewer interspersed spaces between the coding genes.

**Fruit fly genome** - The fruit fly genome is more complex than the yeast genome, but less so than the human. It has more interspersed sequences and less gene density.

#### What is the advantage of alternative splicing?

Alternative splicing allows more information to be stored in any space. If one gene codes for many proteins instead of just one, then the variety of biological functionality increases without taking up more space in a cell. This has to be a beneficial trait.

#### How may long non-coding RNAs influence gene expression?

**Long non-coding RNA**: A noncoding RNA longer than 200 nucleotides in length.

lncRNA are involved in histone modification and chromatin states.

Transcriptional interference. Induce chromatin remodeling and histone modifications.


#### How are microsatellites used in genetic profiling?

**Microsatellite**: A type of simple sequence length polymorphism comprising tandem copies of repeat units. They are also called **short tandem repeat**. The most frequent form of STR's come in di or trinucleotide form.

These microsatellites are like a fingerprint of a individuals genome. No human is the same when it comes to microsatellites. This helps identifying relationships in:

1. Forensic medicine
2. Kinship
3. Population affinites
