# Questions for the colloquium lecture 5 (chapter 7)



## What happens, if species with different chromosome numbers mate?

The newly crossed species cannot mate further. It will be sterile because the number of chromosomes is odd. It needs to be even?
Y chromosomes are not necessary, but the X chromosomes is very important for survival.

If organisms with different diploid number breed they are unlikely to get a fertile child. If the diploid number of the offspring is odd, then that offspring cannot form **homologous pairs** in zygotes.

**Zygotes** is the first cell that forms after sexual reproduction.

## Which parts / structures build the nucleosomes?

Nucleosome is comprised of histones, linker histone. Each nucleosome contains 8 histones. 2 x H2A, H2B, H3, H4 = this is the core octamer. Each Histone has it’s own tail.
-	H1 = linker histone is like a clamp? The single linker attached to the nucleosome forms the **chromatosome**.
-	Nucleosomes: 150 bp DNA around the octamer core plus 50-70 bp between each nucleosome (sort of a rope connecting the two).

Nucleosomes are like pearls on a thread. Distance and structure of nucleosomes affects gene function.
Chromosomes form only when cell division

## Is the linker DNA more or less exposed to mutations?

Yes it is.  It is more exposed. It is more exposed to the environment

## Why is DNA organized into loops?’

DNA is HUGE. It NEEDS to be packed into loops and shiet in order to fit into a cell.

## How is DNA condensed?

Nucleotide pairing, helix, coiling into nucleosomes, nucleosomes gather into a spiral and these spirals are looped. These looped are packed further to form chromosomes.

## What is the difference between heterochromatin and euchromatin?

Heterochromatin is inactive transcriptionally and euchromatin is open and transcriptionally active.

## What is the G-banding pattern and what is it used for?

Karyotypes: En beskrivelse av kromosomes i en celle. Metafase kromosomer farget med Giemsa. G-band. Hvert bånd inneholder mange DNA loops og er 1 to 10 Mb lange. G-band er reproduserbart.
The upper part of a chromosome is called P and the lower is called Q.
G-banding patterns is the human karyogram. rRNA (red) – clusters of repeat units of ribosomal RNA genes.
-	Constitugtive heterochromatin, very
G-banding is a mild proteolysis followed by staining with Giemsa. Dark bands are AT-rich and pale bands are GC-rich.

## Why are getting the telomeres shorter?

The telomeres are hundred of copies of 5'-TTAGGG-3' in humans.

Telomeres mark the END of the chromosomes. They are repetitive ends. Telomeres shorten as cells divide.

Shelterin – these protects the ends of the telomere.
Kjønnsceller, stamceller og kreftceller har en større mengde telomerase.
Telomerase forlenger telomeren.

## What is the relationship between size and complexity of a genome?
Humans have a huge genome. 3 GB.
Planter kan ha sinnsykt stort genom. Planter kan ha flere chromosompar.
Size coincides somehow with the complexity of the organism – fungi have small genomes, mammals bigger genomes. But not complete. Plants are insanely bigger genomes than humans. The reason for this is that space is saved by more closely packing of the genome in lower organisms.
Alternative splicing.


## Are gene distributed evenly within a genome?

No it is not.

One evidence is the results from chromosome staining. Giemsa has a high affinity to DNA regions that are AT-rich. G-banding showed that approx. 60% of the base pairs are A and T. Cytogeneticists then predicted that there would be fewer genes in dark G-banding area, because genes generally have a 50% content of AT. not 60%.

Other evidence is the isochore model. H3, which is small as fuck. Contains 25% of the genes.

## What are gene deserts?

Genes desert are chromosomal regions which are several megabase pairs long, that has a low protein-coding density.

## Which differences exist between the genome of yeast, fruit fly, ad humans?

Yeast has 16 chromosomes, four times as many as the fruit fly. Humans have 46 chromosomes,

## What is the advantage of alternative splicing?

The same amount of information can amount to more diversity of genes.

## How may long non-coding RNAs influence gene expression?



## Why is half of the functions of human genes unknown?

Because most of the functionality of the genes are only predicted, not actually observed through experiment.

## Which process may give rise to multigene families?



## Which processes may lead to pseudogenes?

Mutations, recombination that inactivates genes.

## How are microsatellites used in genetic profiling?

microsatellites are very individual in their length. There is a big chance of relation if the same size of microsatellites are found within or at the same genomic spacing.

## definitions

**Interspersed repeat**: Sequences that recur at many places in the genome. There are four main types of intterspersed repeats; *SINE* short interspersed nuclear elements, *LINE* long interspersed nuclear elements, *LTR* long terminal repeat and *DNA transposons*. Multiple copies of each type are seen in this short segment of the genome, in both the intergenic regions nad in the introns of the protein-coding genes. These are just varying sizes of repeats.

**C-value paradox**: It is the lack of precise correlation between complexity of the organism and its genome. Higher complexity is not precisely correlated with amount of genes or such.
