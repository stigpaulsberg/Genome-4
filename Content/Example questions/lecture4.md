# Questions for the colloquium lecture 4


##### What are homologous genes?

Homologous genes are genes that share a *common ancestor*. This is revealed by sequence similarities.

1. **Orthologous genes** - These are genes that are present in different organisms, but have the same or very similar functionalities.

2. **Paralog genes** - These are homologue genes that are present in the same organism. So a organism contains two genes that have the same or similar function.

##### What is homologous recombination?

Homologous recombination is a exchange in segments of molecules. This occurs between two DNA molecules with similar sequence. It is a gene inactivation mutation.

##### What can they tell us about evolution?

What can homologous recombination and genes tell us about evolution?

It can infer relationships between species, a common ancestry, and that genes go through small changes something???

##### What are protein domains?

Protein domains are functionality characteristics. A categorization of proteins based on their structure and biological function.

Zinc-fingers is a exemplary domain.

##### Why are protein domains important for the analysis of gene functions?

Protein domains are characteristics based on the tertiary structure of a protein that gives its biological function. So protein domains are important because it tells you what function a gene might have.

##### What may be the limitations of sequence alignment using the BLAST program?

Two problems with it:

1. It is only efficient at identifying homologous genes that have more than 40% sequence similarities.

2. A growing problem is the presence in the databases of genes whose functions have been stated incorrectly. If one of these genes is identified as a homolog of the query sequence, then the incorrect function will be passed on to this new sequence, adding to the problem.

##### Why is half of the functions of human genes unknown?

Because most of the genes are not actually experimentally validated, only predicted based on for example domains

##### How to study gene expression using mutational analysis in model organisms?



##### What is RNAi?

RNAi is a RNA molecule naturally made by organisms to control gene expression. It comes in the form of:

- siRNA (short-interfering RNA)
- MicroRNA

Their function is to silence expression by destroying the mRNA and not the gene/DNA

##### How to study functional gene suppression and overexpression?

To overexpress a gene, a special type of cloning vector must be used. A cloning vector needs to ensure that the cloned gene synthesizes as much protein as possible. The vector needs to be a **multicopy**, meaning it makes 40-200 copies per cell.
