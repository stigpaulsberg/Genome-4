# Linkage analysis

This is a method for making a physical map of a genome. This is based upon the idea by Arthur Sturtevant that *frequency of recombination* between two genes is *proportional* to those two genes *distance* between each other on a genome.

This is not 100% bullet proof, but sufficiently accurate and beautiful.

**Exceptions**: Recombination hotspots. These are areas where the frequency of recombination is higher than those of others.
