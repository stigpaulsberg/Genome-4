# Questions for lecture 3

##### Which enzymes are used for cutting DNA?

Restriction enzymes

##### Which enzymes are used for amplification/synthesis of DNA?

Polymerase

##### What is the reaction called, binding a DNA sequence to another?

Ligation

##### What is the principle of "running DNA on a gel"?

It is the method of gel-electrophoresis. It separates DNA fragments in a electric field based on their size because of the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA.

##### How is chain-termination sequencing performed?

1. DNA or RNA molecules are charged and move in a gel to a definite direction by applying an electric field

2. DNA molecules are labeled with radioisotopes or fluorescent dyes

3. Synthesize a complimentary chain and interrupt chain elongation with dideoxynucleotides specific for each nucleotide.

**To sequence: Read the order of bases from the smallest to the largetst**

##### How is next-generation sequencing performed?

Next-generation sequencing is a collection of methods. It is rapid and costly, and produces millions of sequences at one time

The principle is as follows:

- First step: build a library (library: collection of DNA fragments cloned into vectors)
- Massive parallel array format
Base pairing to oligonucleotide on a array format/glass plates or metallic beads.
- DNA fragments: 100-500 bp length
Amplification of immobilized DNA
- Random breaking of the fragments
- Sequencing from the ends

This is cheaper, faster and can possibly be automated.

##### What is third and fourth generation sequencing?

###### Third generation
This is a sequencing that is done in real time, and not fragment by fragment. It is able to create a single molecule and not just fragments.

PacBio sequencing:
- Improved optical sensors
- Read lengths: up to 20 000 bp.
- Label immediately removed after nucleotide incorporation

###### Fourth generation
It is a nanopore approach.

##### Which genomic area may cause trouble for sequencing projects?

Repetitive sequences.

##### What is the "exome"?

The exome are all the protein coding elements present in a cell. The protein coding part of a genome.

##### What is "comparative genomics"?

It is a gene prediction research strategy that uses information obtained from the study of one genome to make inferences about the map positions and functions of genes in a second genome. It is a more accurate strategy than homology searches.
