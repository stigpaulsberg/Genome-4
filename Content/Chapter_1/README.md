# Overview - Chapter 1
## Genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes



The human genome consist of nuclear genome and mitochondrial genome.

*The nuclear* genome are 24 chromosomes = 22 autosomes + x and y chromosome. Approx 3 235 000 000 bp of DNA and we have around 45 500 genes present in this genome.
*The mitochondrial* genome is a circular DNA molecule of 17000 base pairs and there are 10 copies of it. This codes for 37 genes in total.


### Definitions
---
**Somatic cells**: Any cell of a living organism that is not a reproductive cell. Not so sexy cell.

**Haploid**: Haploid cells are generates after meiosis when the number of chromosomes are halved. These are sex cells. Need two of these, one from female and one from male to form offspring.

**Diploid**: Any cell containing two copies of each autosome plus two sex chromosomes.
